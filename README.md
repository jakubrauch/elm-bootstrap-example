# elm-bootstrap-example

Work in progress - created a simple todo-list - no bootstrap added yet.

By the time I was finished writing code that would reflect in the model all input field changes I suddenly realized that
 the only thing missing in my app is addition this text to a list - a trivial job!
 Everything else is already implemented and verified by the compiler.
  
If you ever liked working with enums in Java because they gave you the confidence of what are the possible
 values - you will love Elm for being very explicit. I had some doubts in what others said about Elm - that you get all
  the issues on compilation time. I also doubted in clarity of the compiler messages. I... was wrong.
  I used to code in OCaml, tried a bit of Haskell, but they did not give me the same feeling of confidence in the
   correctness of the code as Elm does.
